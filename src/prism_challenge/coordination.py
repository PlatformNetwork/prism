"""Coordination-plane integration for prism re-execution (architecture.md sections 3, 4, 7).

The master coordinates evaluation but never executes it. A prism submission becomes EXACTLY ONE
``gpu`` work unit (``work_unit_id == submission_id``); a balanced, capability-aware pass on the
master assigns it to exactly one ONLINE gpu validator with concurrency 1, and that validator runs
the whole re-execution on its OWN broker (see :mod:`prism_challenge.validator_executor`).

This module is the prism half of that contract: it exposes a submission's pending work unit to the
master plane and provides the validator-side ``pull`` view (capability- and concurrency-filtered).
It is deliberately execution-free - it never touches the broker/``DockerExecutor`` - so the
coordinator can enumerate and assign work without invoking any executor (VAL-PRISM-037).
