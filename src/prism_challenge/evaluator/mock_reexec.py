"""Mockable CPU re-execution of the prism validator harness (architecture.md sections 7, 10).

There is no GPU (and no live broker) in the test/CI environment, so the GPU re-execution the
validator dispatches to its OWN broker is exercised here by running the SAME challenge-owned
``runner.py`` in a single local CPU process (``nproc=1``, deterministic). This drives the real
forced-random-init + online-loss capture + prequential-bpb authoring and persists a real
``prism_run_manifest.v2`` + ``trained_state.pt`` WITHOUT a GPU, so the scoring/anti-cheat path is
validated end-to-end. The real GPU broker run is wired at deploy.

The mock is a drop-in for ``DockerExecutor.run``: tests monkeypatch
``prism_challenge.evaluator.container.DockerExecutor.run`` with :func:`cpu_reexec_run` so the
production ``PrismContainerEvaluator.evaluate`` path is unchanged. Before running, the mock asserts
the dispatched :class:`DockerRunSpec` is network-isolated (``network=none``) and mounts ONLY the
workspace + writable artifacts dir (never the secret val/test split), mirroring the deploy posture
(VAL-PRISM-013/014/028/039).
