"""Bounded forced-seed ``build_model`` instantiation gate (architecture.md section 4.1).

The static phase instantiates the miner's ``build_model(ctx)`` under the challenge-forced seed
BEFORE any GPU work so that contract/instantiation problems are caught cleanly and hostile
construction is time/resource-bounded. The factory runs in a short-lived child process with a
wall-clock budget and an address-space cap, so an infinite loop or a memory balloon at
construction is killed there instead of stalling the worker. The AST sandbox has already vetted
every script, so the child loads the architecture entrypoint with normal builtins to mirror the
GPU runner and avoid false rejections of legitimate PyTorch code.
