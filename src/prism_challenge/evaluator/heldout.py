"""Host-side held-out delta + anti-memorization gap (architecture.md sections 5, 6).

The held-out delta-over-random-init is the scoring TIE-BREAKER:
``delta = bpb(random-init twin on val) - bpb(trained model on val)`` where a LARGER improvement
ranks better. The challenge also records the train-vs-held-out gap
(``gap = bpb(trained on val) - prequential train bpb``) as an ANTI-MEMORIZATION flag and penalizes
an excessive gap.

The secret ``val`` split is NEVER bind-mounted into the network=none eval container (VAL-HARNESS-015
/ VAL-CHEAT-007) and is never exposed via ``PrismContext``; only the CHALLENGE SCORER reads it, here
on the worker host. To compute the held-out bpb the in-container runner persists the trained
weights (``trained_state.pt``); this module rebuilds the miner architecture under the FORCED seed
(both a random-init twin and a fresh model loaded with the trained weights) and evaluates both on
val. The factory + forward run in a short-lived, time/memory-bounded ``forkserver`` child (mirroring
``static_instantiation``) so a hostile model cannot stall or balloon the worker.

To complete LIVE within a bounded compute budget (the full secret-val eval is single-threaded on
the manager CPU and overruns a tight timeout), the held-out eval is capped to a FIXED, DETERMINISTIC
val byte budget: only a stable prefix of the val split is scored, and the SAME prefix is used for
both the random-init twin and the trained model so the delta stays comparable. The timeout is
configurable (raised for the scorer). The byte denominator keeps the delta tokenizer-agnostic and
the fixed prefix keeps it deterministic (same submission + seed + budget => same delta).

    weights are absent, the secret val split is unavailable, or the bounded child cannot produce a
    finite/positive held-out bpb for both models.

    ``val_byte_budget`` caps the host-side compute to a FIXED, DETERMINISTIC prefix of the secret
    val split (at most this many raw UTF-8 bytes, plus one boundary-crossing document). The twin and
    the trained model are scored over the IDENTICAL prefix so the delta stays comparable and
    directionally correct, while the eval completes LIVE within budget. A value <= 0 scores the
    whole val split.

    ``train_data_dir`` (when resolvable host-side) switches the anti-memorization GAP to use the
    CONVERGED (final-checkpoint) train bpb as the train reference: the trained model is re-evaluated
    byte-level over a fixed prefix of the exposed train split (the SAME byte-level method as val),
    so the gap is a like-for-like comparison of the converged model's train vs held-out performance.
    This closes a false-negative hole in the prequential reference: the curve-averaged prequential
    train bpb is inflated by early high-loss steps, which SHRINKS the gap and can MISS a genuine
    memorizer. Because both sides are byte-level on the same trained model, the converged gap is
    basis-consistent by construction (no tokenizer-basis false-flag).

    ``train_bpb_basis`` is the tokenizer basis the run's prequential TRAIN bpb was measured on. It
    only governs the PREQUENTIAL fallback used when ``train_data_dir`` is unavailable: the held-out
    val bpb is always byte-level (``VAL_BPB_BASIS``), so the prequential-reference gap is applied
    ONLY when the two bases are like-for-like, sparing a benign tokenizer-using learner from a false
    flag (VAL-SCORE-009 / VAL-SCORE-004). The byte-denominator delta tie-breaker (random twin vs
    trained, both byte-level on val) stays valid regardless of the train basis.
